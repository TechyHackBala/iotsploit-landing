            <p>IOT technology is here to empower your life and your business.</p>
            <p>Instead it is becoming the Wild Wild West playground for cyber criminals before the technology has a chance of being widely adopted.</p>
            <p>We manage this risk by detecting and eliminating network vulnerabilities.</p>

                Security is the #1 problem according to Gartner, a leading authority on IT research & and other leading consultants such as Deloitte

            <div class="why-item">
                If your network is compromised, chances are the intruder will have access to more than one source of sensitive data e.g. financial info, email, CCTV cameras, lifestyle habits etc
            </div>
            <div class="why-item">
                IOT economics is based on cheap sensors at the expense of security putting customers/enterprises at risk. Cyber criminals increasingly and regularly help themselves to unsecured but multiplying private and enterprise IOT networks to steal private/financial data and gain control of enterprises.

                    <p>IOTsploit automates scanning for network vulnerabilities and protects the IOT perimeter against weak passwords, obsolete/vulnerable software, known external threats.</p>
                    <p>This is done by detecting open ports, assessing the software, password matching using advanced databases and software and searching for vulnerabilities using the largest open sources vulnerability databases.</p>
                    <p>We generate personalised reports with recommendations based on individual findings. We donâ€™t stop here. We take on the behavioural inertia by the horns by following up to check on two things: the implementation of security recommendations and level of security robustness of new adopted changes.</p>
